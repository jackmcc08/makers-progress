# Week Goals

1. Build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.
2. Request and use data from an external API.
3. Explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.

## Summary

Overall the week's coding was very enjoyable, with a good team to work on the notes app, and we produced a respectable app with the minimal amount of stress, which included several cool aspects including API calls, async functions, our own testing suite and all in Vanilla JS. So there was some good learning and I also managed to get some self learning practicals done.

The weekend challenge was however tough, not so much with the actual code base as I could write the code to get it to work, but more on getting the mocked tests to work and also on getting the async codes to pass properly!

More practice needed on these matters.

## Evidence & Validation


| Goal  | **1. Build a frontend single-page app using only pure Javascript.** |
|---|---|
|Reflect| ability to build end to end a frontend page is important to demonstrate the skills you have learnt |
| Evidence |
| 1 | as part of a team built the notes app where I contributed to the testing suite, the html, the interface and model |
| 2 | built a basic chitter front end, using mocking, api calls and vanilla JS (except for Jamsine). |
| Validation|
| 1 | Although i did not get the chitter working the way I wanted, it still worked so I was happy with my progress there |
|Achieved?| Partial, still need to practice! |

| Goal  | **2. Request and use data from an external API.** |
|---|---|
|Reflect| Important for interfacing with other programs and services. |
| Evidence |
| 1 | In the notes app, worked on interfacing with the emoji API. |
| 2 | In the chitter app, used curl to test the API, also succesfully interacted with the API for getting peeps, signing in, signing up and creating peeps. |
| Validation|
| 1 | Succesfully interacted with several apis, also managed to mock one which was helpful in the understanding of the testing |
|Achieved?| Yes - I think I am starting to get the basics of it |

| Goal  | **3. Explain that libraries are made of ordinary code that I could write myself if I needed to.** |
|---|---|
|Reflect| useful for not getting overawed by libraries |
| Evidence |
| 1 | Built a small testing suite from scratch |
| 2 | Wrote jQuery applications in vanilla JS |
| Validation|
| 1 | Demonstrated this through use of Vanilla JS |
|Achieved?| Partial - yes I get the goal, but I am still working on the writing it myself! |
