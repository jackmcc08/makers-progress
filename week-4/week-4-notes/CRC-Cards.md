- one to one
- one to many
- many to one

#### Database Tips
- Having more tables and classes is not expensive
- Adding more records (rows) is not expensive
- But adding columns / changing to the schema is expensive
- Only need one table to know about the relationship
- You want the relationship to only go in one direction
- Good to know how in SQL would you extract the data when modelling the relationship.
- With Many to Many relationships, you would have a join table.
