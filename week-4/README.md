# Goal Tracking

- Each week will use a document like the below to a) plan and b) track progress against the goals.
- Evidence can then be written up as needed.
    - check that you are on the right trajectory towards your goal
    - important to learn that you have enough
    - work from weak to strong evidence
    -

# Week Goals

1. Build a simple web app with a database
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

## Summary

Overall last week went well in terms of learning as there were quite a few new areas to touch on and learn, including databases and integrating databases into the MVC web app. It was however a tough week personally which made it a little difficult to stay on top of all the topics and meant I couldn't progress as far in my weekend challenge.

I liked learning about databases and setting them up, as well as pulling information from them.

I found it tough to understand the outputs of the PG gem, but on the weekend I sat down and worked it out as much as possible, which gave me a big boost for my weekend project.

    - [ ] Explore HTTPS
    - [ ] Write up notes on how the web works
    - [ ] Look into SQL Injection
    - [ ] Review week 4 practicals on SQL Zoo, SQL Murder Mystery, build a diary app.

1. Build a simple web app with a database
    - [x] Afternoon challenge
        - [x] Monday with Taran - did up to challenge 8
        - [x] Tuesday with Inbad - did up to challenge 10
        - [x] Wednesday with Ralph - did up to challenge 13
        - [x] Thursday with Will Spencer
        - [x] Friday with Lou Reade
    - [ ] Do SQL zoo practical
    - [ ] SQL Murder Mystery practical
    - [ ] builde a diary app
    - [x] Weekend challenge
    - [x] Explored PG gem which gave me a better understanding of integrating with the database.
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
    - [x] Through day to day work
        - Figured out how to do a delete and puts route
        - Cracked more than few bugs on getting information into and out of databases.
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)
    - [x] CRC cards workshop
        - Showed how to build up database structures against the user stories - to combine with domain modelling
    - [x] Entity Relationship Diagrams
        - gave an insight into one to one, one to many and many to many relationships and how to code them




## Evidence & Validation

| Goal  | **1. Build a simple web app with a database** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| *What does this learning goal mean and why is it relevant?* |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Built the bookmark manager during the afternoon challenges, which integrated sinatra MVC with postgresql databases. |
 | 2 | Completed the weekend chitter challenge, integrating the Sinatra MVC with PostgreSQL database. |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Put together two web apps with databases. Also wrote up some resources for using the PG gem to validate my understanding.  |
 | 2 | Able to integrate delete and puts routes through the erb into the router |
 |Achieved?| Yes  - put together two web apps with databases |


  | Goal  | **2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Very necessary to effectively build web applications. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | worked through setting up delete routes |
 | 2 | spent a lot of time figuring out how to utilise the PG gem |
 | 3 | on weekend challenge, debugged implementing CSS |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | succesfully debugged - the afternoon and weekend challenges. |
  |Achieved?| Yes Need more practice|

   | Goal  | **3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Good understanding of databases allows you to manipulate them more effectively |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Completed CRC workshop |
 | 2 | Developed several databases for the various projects |
 | 3 | Did entity relationships diagrams practical to understand more about different database relationships. |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Able to effectively implement basic databases with one to one, one to many and many to many relationships. |
  |Achieved?| Partial  -  understand basics, but need to use more databases to understand better |
