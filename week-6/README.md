# Week Goals

1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language

## Summary

Last week was a short week - 4 days and was a slow introduction to Javascript, i found the thermostat challenge enjoyable and introduced a few nice items like JQuery, jasmine and a good way to build full javascript web apps.

The weekend challenge was a step up in complexity, and highlighted the need for the translation practical (which I did not complete), as there were many things I felt very comfortable doing in Ruby that I struggled with in JS. However I battled through and put together a basic UI and model (I also felt I SRPd it better than the ruby version).

## Evidence & Validation

| Goal  | **1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript** |
|---|---|
|Reflect| learning by doing! |
| Evidence |
| 1 | Completed the afternoon thermostat challenge |
| 2 | Completed weekend bowling scorecard challenge |
| 3 | Completed workshops - debugging and callbacks |
| Validation|
| 1 | |
|Achieved?| partial - I feel that I have some concrete knowledge of javascript, but it is not yet cemented and needs more work |

| Goal  | **2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language** |
|---|---|
|Reflect| good for learning new items |
| Evidence |
| 1 | did afternoon and weekend challenges |
| 2 | was able to translate some of my ruby methodology to Javascript |
| Validation|
| 1 | |
|Achieved?| No - did not complete practicals nor did I feel i really grasped JS |
