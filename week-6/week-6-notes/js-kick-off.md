## When learning Ruby, what did you find useful?
Ruby guides (documentation / tutorials)
Try and do things in a different way (working with arrays, exploring methods, etc)
Pairing, bounce off ideas and explain things, test your understanding
Diagramming
TDD / Testing / RSpec
Writing random notes / freeform diagramming / notes
Doing stuff (practice and practice)
Project-based work, doing something actually useful
Cheatsheets (quick memory refresher)

## What do you already know about Javascript? (keywords, concepts, libraries, etc)
Very common, very popular
Frameworks/libraries: React, jQuery -> front-end libraries (execute on the browser)
Node.js (backend)
High-level language like Ruby (a lot of similar concepts)
Data types are similar (JS doesnâ€™t differentiate integers and floats)
We can run it inside a browser
DOM manipulation (JS in an HTML page, JS to manipulate elements of the page/HTML)



## Why would we learn another language?
Different companies use different languages
Expanding how you think, broader understanding on how to solve problems
Languages are like tools
