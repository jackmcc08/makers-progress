# Week Goals

1. Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
2. Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
3. Run stand-ups and retrospectives
4. Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
5. Give and receive meaningful code review

## Summary

This week has been an excellent week, building on the skills we learnt over the past 4 weeks and our first group project of 4. Key this week was practicing github branching and merging, which was a great lesson in patience and frustration, as well as deleting and pulling and hoping for the best.

We put together a great project which was heavy on the css styling, delivered some solid functionality and we built an mvp in less than two days. The project included sign in and sign out, booking, listing and viewing rooms.

Weekend project: Weekend project was a good ruby refresher, where I just wrote out a bowling scorecard model. It was interesting because of its complexity and provided some interesting refactoring challenges. For example for the 10th frame logic I wrote it out longhand and then refactored it into my existing private methods so that now the 10th frame logic is embedded with all the rest of the logic.



#### Weeks practicals

1. Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
    - [x] Group engineering project
        - Using trello
        - Broke out MVP into user stories
        - Added additional user stories once the MVP was complete
        -
2. Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
    - [x] Group engineering project
        - Analysed first specifications and broke it out into user stories
3. Run stand-ups and retrospectives
    - [x] Group Engineering Project
        - Agreed structure for project and had first stand up
4. Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
    - [x] Group Engineering Project
    - [x] Ran a few tests with group on using git to merge and branch git
5. Give and receive meaningful code review

## Evidence & Validation

 | Goal  | **1. Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Need to adequately break up specifications in order to be able to build them properly.  |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Broke up specifications for Makers HnD to user stories to build mvp |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | |
 |Achieved?| Yes - get the concept, but need more practice.|

  | Goal  | **2. Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Important to break down client requirements and translate what they want tinto code. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Built an mvp from the spec out of four user stories. |
 | 2 | added additional spec in an agile manner |
 | 3 | Delivered code review based on specifications |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | |
 |Achieved?| Partial, need more practice|

  | Goal  | **3. Run stand-ups and retrospectives** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Important to be able to work together with people and agree priorities and tasks. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | held daily stand -ups and retros in the short challenge |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | succesfully directed and completed the weekend challenge. |
 |Achieved?| Yes held stand-ups and retros respectively. |

  | Goal  | **4. Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Vital to managing projects with more than one person |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Succesfully completed afternoon challenge |
 | 2 | Had a group learning session on github merging and branching |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Successfully debugged several merges and rebases |
 |Achieved?| Partial - need to reinforce with weekend learning |

  | Goal  | **5. Give and receive meaningful code review** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Important to be able to get feedback and improve on the feedback, as well as give clear and straight feedback to other coders so that they can improve. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Had first external Review, went well. need to improve on commmit messages, refactoring sooner, don't write tests you know will pass. |
 | 2 | Had a code review of weekend challenge with Jack H. |
 | 3 | Got weekend exercise feedback from a coach |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Got good feedback on the review |
 |Achieved?| Partial - still need to practice |
