# Week Goals

1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
4. Explain the MVC pattern

## Summary

Overall week 3 was very interesting with a new topic of web apps to cover. We covered Sinatra for web apps and feature testing with capybara. We also started learning about the model view controller and the html response cycle which aided in debugging the web apps.

The weekend challenge was enjoyable with a good opportunity for creativity using css and html styling.

The pairing sessions were generally productive and helped reinforce building a web app.

Ups - writing web apps and learning feature testing.
Downs - few issues with using the correct versions of gems.

## Evidence & Validation

 | Goal  | **1. Build a simple web app** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Continued practice is a good way to cement skill sets |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Built sinatra web app in afternoon challenge |
 | 2 | Completed birthday tracker app |
 | 3 | Completed weekend challenge - sinatra web app with html and css - rock paper scissors |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Helped peer partners understand the afternoon challenge and ensured I was able to adequately explain |
 |Achieved?| yes - I understand the basics of Sinatra and setting up a simple web app |


  | Goal  | **2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| learn how to debug a program which has more components than simple Ruby Programs. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Completed Debugging Workshop |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Succesfully debugged several issues we had while building Sinatra web apps |
 | 2 | I felt I was able to step back and run through the debugging cycle |
  |Achieved?|  yes - was able to succesfully resolves bugs in generally a short amount of time |

   | Goal  | **3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Need to be able to understand the basics to be able to more effectively write apps |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | attended HTTP workshop |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | succesfully built several web apps |
 | 2 | able to trace bugs through the process and ensure apps are working correctly |
  |Achieved?| Partial - need to write up to be able to reinforce learning |

   | Goal  | **4. Explain the MVC pattern** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| MVC pattern is a way of building web apps in a logical way with clearly divided responsibilities. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Built several web apps using the MVC patters |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Applied thin views and controllers |
  |Achieved?| Partial - need to read around the subject more in order to get a good understanding of it |
