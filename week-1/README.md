## Evidence & Validation

 | Goal  | **1. Test-drive a simple Program using Objects and methods** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Test driving is critical to writing efficient programs that actually are known to meet the user requirements (as demonstrated via tests). It also avoids adding features which are not necessary. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Attended the TDD Process workshop |
 | 2 | Completed the TDD_process and TDD_birthday practicals |
 | 3 | TDD developed Boris Bikes up to challenge 18 |
 | 4 | Completed Weekend Challenge entirely through TDD |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | n/a - awaiting code review/feedback on weekend challenges. |
 |Achieved?| Yes  - Feel that I understand the basis of test-driving and why we do so. But more practice needed to ensure strict adherence to red-green-refactor process and also focusing on refining user-stories first. |


  | Goal  | **2. Pair using the driver-navigator style** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Being able to pair well and understand how to do it, is a good route to build more efficient and effective code |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Using three way pairing on day two to reach step 9 of the Boris Bike challenge |
 | 2 | Paired with max on Wednesday to reach step 14 of the boris bike challenge, succesfully debugged the previous days issues together and both of us worked our way through new material on rspec |
 | 3 | Paired with Alex on Thursday to reach step 18 of the challenge, succesfully learnt some new concepts on Constants. Also paired on the TDD_process workshop exercise. |
 | 4 | Paired with Will on Friday to cover steps 12 to 15 on boris bikes. Succesfully debugged several issues. Explained Attr_reader, etc...  |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | n/a - need to seek feedback from pair partners next week |
  |Achieved?| Partial  - felt I paired well, did not jump in on every spelling mistake, also helped try and navigate a step ahead occasionally - more progress required. |

   | Goal  | **3. Follow an effective debugging process** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Important to understand and have a good debugging process in order to be able to fix your code errors in an efficient and effective manner. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Attended Debugging workshop - Wednesday and completed tasks |
 | 2 | Completed Debugging Approaches Practical - solved all 4 exercises |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Succesfully applied debugging to get my afternoon challenges and weekend challenges working |
 | 2 | Helped pair partner debug several pieces of their code while I was navigator. |
  |Achieved?| Yes  - feel I have a good grasp of basic debugging and have applied it succesfully |

   | Goal  | **4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Through understanding the principles of object orientated programming well it allows us to more easily apply them with intent to our programs.|
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Read through the wikis on encapsulation, SRP, wrote up a brief summary of what I learnt |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | In developing the weekend challenge, sought to implement the principles of OOP, and made some progress in ensuring encapsulation and SRP was followed. Also learnt to identify when it was violated. |
  |Achieved?| Partial - need more research and practice to cement learning |
