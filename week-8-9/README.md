# Week Goals

1. Can you use high-quality processes to build a project in a team?

## Summary

Week 8 went very well - we had the first week of our group engineering project on Acebook with 8 people. We have a good team spirit, taking the opportunity to learn new knowledge and share what we have discovered/learnt. We also broke up the work into manageable chunks and split pair partners regularly to allow for people to work with different groups.

Initially it was slow going, but eventually it picked up pace and now we are all aware of what we are working on.

The final weekend challenge of the course Instagram was a great mini project (although I did not have much time to spend on it), it was very interesting to develop my rails skills further and I was able to maintain test coverage!

Week 9 went even better, with more of a deep dive into some cool rails features, like partials, and ajax routing and integrating javascript into the front end.

We also spent time refining the design and getting it to work well, which helped develop my understanding of css.

Overall the demo of the project worked really well and all the team members managed to contribute in significant ways to the project.

The team had a good atmosphere and everybody came away a better programmer than they joined.
