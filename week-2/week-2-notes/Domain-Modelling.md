# Domain Modelling

#### Why do we have multiple class

- SRP
- Manage code easier
- Understand what each block does

#### Understand how diagramming could support our understanding of a problem

#### Use diagramming as a technique to inform how we might design our program before writing code

Create the signed_in? method a predicate method?


Domain Modelling becomes part of the internal process, but in implementing a new set of code you might map it out.
