## EXERCISE 1
# Implement tic-tac-toe
# I can see the board on the screen
# I can put an x on the board
# I can put an o on the board
# You might need more than one class for this, but you don't need to create them all up front if you don't want to.
#
# Remember, test behaviour, not state. Go through the example again if you're not sure.

## EXERCISE 2
# Refactored an existing test
