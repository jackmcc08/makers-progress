# Week Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Evidence & Validation

 | Goal  | **1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Continued practice is a good way to cement skill sets |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Paired with Sha (monday), Jack H. (Tues - Got to challenge 12), Stu B. (Wed - completed Oystercard), paired with Lou (Thurs) and David (Friday) |
 | 2 | Continued to apply debugging process and apply SRP |
 | 3 | TDD'd afternoon and weekend challenge. Improved by learning more about doubles and stubs to achieve isolated testing. |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Refined Pair programming and broke it down into 20 min chunks to maintain focus |
 |Achieved?| Yes  - Still applying pairing and TDD |


  | Goal  | **2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Breaking down a classes and extracting into multiple classes is a good way to ensure SRP and allows you to make the program more robust and flexible. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Afternoon challenge - Oystercard, went from 1 class to 4 classes |
 | 2 | Weekend Challenge - Takeaways, built program as one class first before breaking out into 4 seperate classes |
 | 3 | Completed Domain Modelling workshop which gave me practice in how to identify seperate objects, responsibilities and classes. |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | still achieved 100% test coverage on the takeaway after breaking out the classes |
  |Achieved?| Yes  -  Understand how to break out classes and maintain test coverage. Still need more practice in extracting classes. |

   | Goal  | **3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| This allows you to test each class individually and ensure you are testing the right class. It also means if you break another part of your program you can still test the working parts. |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Completed mocking and stubs workshop |
 | 2 | Used mocks to test all of the weekend classes in isolation, even Twilio. |
 | 3 | Applied dependency injection to be able to mock classes more effectively. |
 | 4 | Completed dependency injection and testing behaviour over state practical. |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | |
  |Achieved?| Yes - I feel that I understand the concept, more practice needed. |

   | Goal  | **4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Applying OO principles is a good way to write clean code which is also robust to change.
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Completed Forwarding and Polymorphism principle |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Applied Forwarding priniciples in my takeaway challenge |
  |Achieved?| Partial  - Still need lots of practice and to review the OO principles in more detail. |

 | Goal  | **5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback** |
 |---|---|
 |Reflect| Reviewing anothers code gives you hints how to make code more readable and learn tips and tricks from others (even see where they went wrong!) |
 | Evidence |
 | 1 | Attended review and process workshops to understand more about reviewing |
 | 2 | Reviewed a peers code and gave detailed comments which we then had a discussion about |
 | Asked a coach for review of some questions and had a good interaction |
 | Validation|
 | 1 | Attended Review Workshop and got good feedback from my peer on the Airport Challenge |
 | 2 | Attended process workshop and got good feedback |
 |Achieved?| Yes  - understand the goal but need more practice|
